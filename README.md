[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/basho/erlang_protobuffs.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/basho/erlang_protobuffs)

This module is a composite of other open source modules and original code to
facilitate interfacing with Protocol Buffers.

## Encode / Decode

Encoding:

    1> protobuffs:encode(1, 1, uint32).
    ["\b",[1]]
    2> erlang:iolist_to_binary([
        protobuffs:encode(1, <<"Nick">>, string),
        protobuffs:encode(2, 25, uint32)
    ]).
    <<10,4,78,105,99,107,16,25>>

Decoding:

    1> protobuffs:decode(<<8, 1>>, uint32).
    {{1, 1}, <<>>}
    2> protobuffs:decode(<<10,4,78,105,99,107,16,25>>, bytes).
    {{1, <<"Nick">>}, <<16,25>>}
    3> protobuffs:decode(<<16,25>>, bytes).
    {{2, 25}, <<>>}

## Using `.proto` Files

Consider the `test/erlang_protobuffs_SUITE_data/proto/simple.proto` file.

    message Person {
        required string name = 1;
        required string address = 2;
        required string phone_number = 3;
        required int32 age = 4;
        optional Location location = 5;
    }

    message Location
    {
        required string region = 1;
        required string country = 2;
    }

From that file we can create an Erlang module that can encode and decode the
`Person` message into records.

    1> protobuffs_compile:scan_file("simple.proto").
    ok
    2> simple_pb:decode_person(<<10,4,78,105,99,107,18,13,77,111,117,110,116,97,105,110,32,86,105,101,119,26,17,43,49,32,40,48,48,48,41,32,53,53,53,45,49,50,51,52,32,25>>).
    {person,<<"Nick">>,<<"Mountain View">>, <<"+1 (000) 555-1234">>,25,undefined}
    3> simple_pb:encode_person({person, <<"Nick">>, <<"Mountain View">>,
        <<"+1 (000) 555-1234">>,25, undefined}).
    [[["\n",[4],<<"Nick">>],
      [[18],"\r",<<"Mountain View">>],
      [[26],[17],<<"+1 (000) 555-1234">>],
      [" ",[25]],
      []]]

How cool is that? From .proto files, we create modules that export encode and
decode functions for the messages defined.

If you want to encode several messages with automatic delimination as the java
version can, pass in a list of records.

    1> protobuffs_compile:scan_file("simple.proto").
    ok
    2> simple_pb:encode([
        {person, <<"Nick">>, <<"Mountain View">>, <<"+1 (000) 555-1234">>, 25, undefined},
        {person, <<"Jill">>, <<"Denver">>, <<"+1 (000) 555-4321">>, 29, undefined}
    ]).
    [[42,
      [[["\n",[4],<<"Nick">>],
        [[18],"\r",<<"Mountain View">>],
        [[26],[17],<<"+1 (000) 555-1234">>],
        [" ",[25]],
        []]]],
     [35,
      [[["\n",[4],<<"Jill">>],
        [[18],[6],<<"Denver">>],
        [[26],[17],<<"+1 (000) 555-4321">>],
        [" ",[29]],
        []]]]]

If you have a stream of delimited messages and they are all of the same type,
you can automatically have them decoded as well.

    1> simple_pb:delimited_decode_person(<<42,10,4,78,105,99,107,18,13,77,111,117,110,116,97,105,110,32,86,105,101,119,26,17,43,49,32,40,48,48,48,41,32,53,53,53,45,49,50,51,52,32,25,35,10,4,74,105,108,108,18,6,68,101,110,118,101,114,26,17,43,49,32,40,48,48,48,41,32,53,53,53,45,52,51,50,49,32,29>>).
    {[{person,"Nick","Mountain View","+1 (000) 555-1234",25,
              undefined},
      {person,"Jill","Denver","+1 (000) 555-4321",29,undefined}],
     <<>>}

The return from the delimited decode function is a tuple containing the list
of records in the order they were found, and any remaing binary, allowing for
easy maintainance of a buffer.

## Deep lists

You might have noticed that the examples above produce deep lists (also known as
iolists), not binaries, when encoding messages. Since we assume most messages
will be sent to another computer over the network or written to disk, we can
delay flattening the encoding until the last instant, i.e. writing to the port
that will send the message.  All ports accept deep lists, so there's no reason
to flatten them in our encoding or application code. If you absolutely must have
a binary, use the `iolist_to_binary/1` BIF on the encoded message.

## `no_debug_info`

The `protobuffs_compile` module relies on the `pokemon_pb` module being compiled
with debug info. This is because `pokemon_pb` serves as a template for generated
`_pb` modules. Running `protobuffs_compile:scan_file/1` reads the erlang forms
from the `pokemon_pb.beam` file and expands and alters those forms to create the
generated module.

## Building

*NB:* If `rebar` is not in your `PATH` the local `rebar` will be used.

To compile:

```
make
```

To run all tests:

```
make test
```
